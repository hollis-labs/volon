# Volon — Agent Boot Instructions

This repository is managed by **Volon**, an agentic development system.

## Boot Sequence

Before any other work:

1. List the available profiles in `.volon/boot/` (e.g. `orchestrator`, `architect`, `worker`, `reviewer`)
2. Ask the user which profile to use — present the options clearly, plus "Other: Specify"
3. Wait for the user's selection before proceeding
4. Read `.volon/agent-boot.md` (core rules and ground truth sources)
5. Read `.volon/boot/<selected-profile>.md`
6. Read `.volon/bootstrap.md` (current iteration state)
7. Follow the selected profile's instructions, emit the boot confirmation block, and begin work
