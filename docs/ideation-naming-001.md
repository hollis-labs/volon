# Ideation: Project Naming Session 001

## Anchors — What Works (and Why)

Before generating, it helps to understand *why* the existing anchors work:

| Name | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| **Nanite** | Technical precision. Sci-fi heritage (nanotechnology, Starcraft). Small unit, immense collective power. Sounds like a real thing that exists in physics. |
| **Fragments Engine** | Compositional logic — pieces becoming whole. "Engine" signals mechanism, not product. Suggests latent power waiting to be assembled. |
| **Forge** | Industrial transformation. Force applied to raw material to make something permanent. Strong. Unfortunately, extremely overused in dev tooling. |

**What these share:**
- They describe a *mechanism*, not a *feature*
- They have depth — you can sit with them and find more meaning
- They are not self-congratulatory
- They sound like they *do something real*

---

## Semantic Directions to Explore

### Direction 1 — Quorum / Threshold / Emergence
*The swarm intelligence angle. Many acting as one, coordinated by signal.*

This direction maps most directly to the core behavior of the system: distributed agents crossing a threshold into collective coordinated action.

**Quorum** is the most interesting candidate in this cluster. In biology, *quorum sensing* is the mechanism by which bacteria measure population density and, once a threshold is reached, flip behavior simultaneously — swarm attacks, biofilm formation, bioluminescence. They literally wait for enough of themselves to exist before acting. It is:
- Scientifically precise (not a metaphor — it's a real biological mechanism)
- Not overused in dev tooling (Quorum Blockchain is adjacent but distinct)
- Single word, hard consonants, lands well
- Encodes "many acting as one" with elegance
- Has a democratic resonance (quorum = minimum needed to act) that fits orchestration logic

**Adjacent candidates:**
- **Threshold** — too literal, too often used as a metaphor
- **Criticality** — physics term for a system at a critical point (nuclear criticality, phase transitions). Strong but awkward as a name.
- **Critical** — too generic
- **Cascade** — suggests consequences, chain reactions. Clean word, slightly overused.
- **Flux** — continuous transformation. Latin. Clean, but starting to feel dated (Flux architecture, Flux in React era).

**Cluster verdict:** Quorum is exceptional. Cascade and Flux are decent fallbacks.

---

### Direction 2 — Force / Momentum / Leverage
*The agency angle. Something that causes things to happen. A directed force that produces effects larger than itself.*

**Fulcrum** stands out here. A fulcrum is the pivot point that multiplies applied force — a small input creates a large output. This maps precisely to what the system does: apply intent, produce execution. It implies leverage. It is:
- Physics-grounded, not metaphorical
- Durable: Archimedes said "give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world"
- Not soft or cute
- Suggests infrastructure (fixed point) + agency (force amplification)
- Risk: some existing companies/tools use this name; check carefully

**Impetus** is also compelling. From Latin *impetere* — to attack, to rush at. It is the force or momentum that causes action. Encodes agency beautifully. Not overused. Slightly academic.

**Torque** is interesting — rotational force that creates angular acceleration. Implies force applied at a distance, around a center. Has a mechanical, precise quality.

**Adjacent candidates:**
- **Gradient** — direction of steepest ascent; what optimization follows. Strong physics/ML resonance. Risk: heavily colonized by ML community now.
- **Vector** — direction + magnitude. Overused in security (attack vector, malware).
- **Momentum** — too common, too literal
- **Thrust** — energetic but too blunt

**Cluster verdict:** Fulcrum and Impetus are the strongest. Torque is a sleeper.

---

### Direction 3 — Substrate / Infrastructure Layer
*The thing beneath. What everything runs on. Foundational, invisible until it matters.*

**Substrate** is deeply appealing here. In biology, a substrate is what an enzyme acts upon — the raw material for transformation. In electronics, the substrate is the base layer of a chip. In philosophy/systems theory, it's the underlying stuff from which structure emerges. It says: "this is the layer beneath your intent that makes things happen." Infrastructure + cognition in a single word.

Risk: slightly cold, possibly not distinctive enough.

**Manifold** is mathematically rich. A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space — many local structures unified under a consistent higher-dimensional surface. This maps to: many agents, each locally coherent, unified into one structure. It's also used in physics (spacetime manifold), engineering (intake manifold — where flows converge). Strong resonance with "many acting as one."

**Adjacent candidates:**
- **Lattice** — crystalline structure. Each node connected consistently. Clean but feels colder than manifold.
- **Stratum** — layer. Scientific. But implies passivity/sediment rather than agency.
- **Plexus** — network of nerves or vessels; coordination center. Solar plexus, brachial plexus. Organic, suggests distributed sensing. Slightly medical.
- **Filament** — a thin thread connecting nodes. Cosmic web filaments, carbon filaments. Suggests the connective tissue of the system.

**Cluster verdict:** Manifold and Substrate are the strongest. Plexus is a sleeper with organic/biological appeal.

---

### Direction 4 — Eigenstate / Mathematical Precision
*The transformation angle. Names drawn from mathematics and physics that encode the idea of a system finding its determined form.*

**Eigenstate** — In quantum mechanics, an eigenstate is the definite state a system collapses into when observed. Before measurement: superposition. After: eigenstate. There is something compelling in the metaphor of intent collapsing into concrete execution. The system transforms ambiguous input into resolved output.

Risk: very technical. May feel inaccessible. But for the right audience, it signals exactly the right sensibility.

**Attractor** — In dynamical systems theory, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system naturally evolves over time. Strange attractors (Lorenz attractor) are iconic visualizations of chaotic systems that still exhibit structure. A system that pulls execution toward it, that things naturally flow toward. Strong resonance.

**Adjacent candidates:**
- **Invariant** — A quantity preserved under transformation. Too passive.
- **Tensor** — Mathematical object encoding transformations. Used by TensorFlow — association is unavoidable.
- **Spinor** — Quantum geometric object. Too obscure.
- **Propagator** — In quantum field theory, the amplitude for a particle to travel from one point to another. Interesting, but "propagator" in security has negative connotation (malware propagation).

**Cluster verdict:** Attractor is the strongest here. Eigenstate is a bold choice for a technical audience.

---

### Direction 5 — Organic / Distributed Intelligence
*The biology angle. Systems that think, coordinate, and act at the network level.*

**Mycelium** / **Mycel** — The underground fungal network: invisible infrastructure connecting distant nodes, passing signals and nutrients, enabling the visible surface to flourish. Paul Stamets' work has elevated this to cultural prominence. Strong resonance with "many acting as one," distributed intelligence, and invisible infrastructure. Risk: becoming a bit trendy in certain circles (Wood Wide Web discourse). Mycel as a contraction is cleaner.

**Quorum** (revisit from Direction 1) — appears in both swarm intelligence and organic directions. Reinforces its centrality.

**Spore** — Propagation, distribution, emergence. A spore is a minimal viable unit that can become anything. Suggests deployment, spawning, distribution of agents. Clean, one syllable, unexpected in this context.

**Adjacent candidates:**
- **Rhizome** — Deleuze/Guattari's concept; non-hierarchical, horizontal network. Intellectually rich but may feel too academic/philosophy-adjacent.
- **Synapse** — The gap between neurons where signals cross. Coordination at the boundary. Clean single word. Risk: slight overuse in productivity/neuro space.
- **Axon** — The signal-conducting fiber of a neuron. Clean, technical. Suggests unidirectional fast signal.
- **Ganglion** — A cluster of nerve cells; a coordination node. Strong in meaning, but sounds clinical.

**Cluster verdict:** Mycel/Mycelium is compelling but watch for trend risk. Spore is an underrated candidate.

---

## Emerging Themes

After this first sweep, three semantic tensions define the naming space:

**1. Scale of agency**
Some names encode *single-unit action* (Fulcrum, Impetus, Attractor) while others encode *collective action* (Quorum, Mycelium, Manifold). The system does both — intent enters, a swarm executes. Names that encode *the moment of coordination* (Quorum, Fulcrum) may be more precise.

**2. Visibility**
Substrate, Mycelium, and Filament encode *invisible infrastructure* — the hidden layer that makes everything else possible. Fulcrum, Attractor, and Quorum encode *visible mechanism* — you can point at the thing and say "there, that's where it happens." The latter feels stronger for a tool name.

**3. Organic vs. Physics**
The brand anchors (Nanite, Fragments Engine) lean physics/sci-fi more than biology. Quorum is at the intersection — genuinely scientific, but biological in origin. Mycelium is beautiful but more clearly organic.

---

## Candidates to Watch

| Name | Cluster | Strength | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quorum** | Swarm/Threshold | Exceptional — encodes the core behavior precisely | Quorum blockchain exists; need to assess saturation |
| **Fulcrum** | Force/Leverage | Strong agency, leverage, precision | Some tooling uses this name |
| **Manifold** | Substrate/Unification | Mathematically rich, many-into-one | manifold.co exists; some dev tool usage |
| **Impetus** | Force/Momentum | Clean Latin, encodes causation | Slightly academic feel |
| **Attractor** | Dynamical Systems | Strong metaphor, scientifically precise | Lesser-known reference; explain-it tax |
| **Substrate** | Infrastructure | Foundational, scientific | May feel too passive or cold |
| **Mycel** | Organic/Distributed | Beautiful distributed intelligence metaphor | Trending; biological association may jar |
| **Plexus** | Organic/Network | Nerve-network coordination | Medical association |
| **Spore** | Propagation | Minimal, deployable unit angle | One possible meaning feels wrong (spore = disease) |
| **Torque** | Force/Rotation | Precise mechanical force | Less semantic depth than Fulcrum |

---

## What's Not Working (Early Rejections)

- **Gradient** — too colonized by ML/AI community
- **Tensor** — TensorFlow shadow is too strong
- **Vector** — security community owns this word (attack vector)
- **Lattice** — clean but passive; implies static structure
- **Nexus** — overused in dev tooling
- **Synapse** — productivity/neuro app associations
- **Catalyst** — overused as a generic transformation metaphor
- **Cadence** — Uber's Cadence workflow engine exists; too close
- **Flux** — React-era associations, feels early-2010s

---

## Open Questions for Refinement

1. Does the name represent the *system itself* or the *act of orchestration*? (noun vs. verb-derived noun)
2. Is biological vs. physics framing a preference? Quorum bridges both; Manifold and Fulcrum are more physics-pure.
3. Single word vs. compound? (Fragments Engine suggests compound is acceptable — but both words must earn their place)
4. Domain availability matters if OSS: `.dev`, `.run`, `.io` — worth checking for shortlist

---

## Shortlist (Working)

*To be refined through conversation*

1. **Quorum** — swarm threshold, many-into-one, scientifically grounded
2. **Fulcrum** — leverage point, small input / large output, agency
3. **Manifold** — many surfaces unified, mathematical, infrastructure
4. **Impetus** — force that causes motion, clean Latin, durable
5. **Attractor** — system state things naturally move toward, dynamical systems
6. **Mycel** — distributed organic intelligence, invisible infrastructure

---

## Round 2 — Intent Amplification (Primary Frame)

*User confirmed: the system's primary identity is **amplifying intent**. Small, precise input → large, far-reaching execution. This is leverage, not coordination.*

This shifts the entire search. The question becomes: what *mechanism* transforms a minimal input into maximal output? Physics and engineering have many precise words for this.

---

### The Physics of Amplification

**Resonance** — When you drive a system at its natural frequency, small forces produce enormous oscillations. The Tacoma Narrows bridge collapsed from resonance. A singer shatters glass with their voice. The system *matches* the frequency of its environment and amplifies through that matching. This encodes exactly the right idea: not brute force, but precision applied at the right moment in the right way. Scientific, durable, elegant.

Risk: Cohere AI, Resonance Audio (Google), a few apps use this. Not saturated in the orchestration/agentic space.

**Relay** — An electrical relay receives a small control signal and uses it to switch a much larger circuit. The ratio can be enormous — milliamps of intent command amperes of action. One syllable. Precise. Has sci-fi resonance (relay stations, mass relay). Also encodes the passing of work forward — baton, chain, propagation.

Risk: Mass Effect "mass relay" association is strong but not bad. Check OSS tooling saturation.

**Transducer** — An engineering term for a device that converts energy from one form to another. A microphone is a transducer (sound → electrical signal). A speaker is a transducer (signal → sound). The system is a transducer: *intent → execution*. Technically precise. Less well-known than other candidates. Risk: sounds slightly clinical.

**Primer** — In molecular biology, PCR amplification requires a primer: a short, specific DNA sequence that enables the polymerase to massively amplify a target region. The primer is tiny and specific; the output is enormous. In military/engineering: the small charge that initiates a larger detonation. In painting: the base coat that enables everything above it to adhere. It is: intent → amplification. Three clean syllables. Unexpected in this context. Not used in serious dev tooling.

**Effector** — In biology, an effector is the terminal actor in a signaling cascade — the protein/cell that actually *executes* the instruction. Effector T-cells attack. Effector molecules bind targets. "Effector" means: the thing that finally makes the intent real. This is the last link between signal and world. Precise, uncommon in dev tooling, scientific.

**Gain** — In signal processing and electronics, *gain* is the ratio of output to input amplitude. A gain of 10 means the output is ten times the input. It is the amplification factor, stated plainly. Risk: may feel too terse, slightly generic. But has clean, precise scientific meaning.

---

### The Biology of Amplification (Signal Cascades)

**Cascade** — revisit with new frame. A *signal cascade* is how biology amplifies intent: one activated molecule activates dozens, each of which activates dozens more. Kinase cascades, MAPK cascades, PCR signal cascades. The cascade IS the amplification mechanism. Clean word. Hard consonants. Not used heavily in serious orchestration tooling.

Risk: some overuse as a metaphor ("cascade of events"); ReactiveX has "observable chain" vibes. But the signal cascade meaning is specific and scientific.

**Kinase** — the enzyme at the heart of signal cascades. A kinase phosphorylates (activates) other proteins, triggering downstream effects. One kinase can activate thousands of proteins. Too biochemical as a standalone name, but the concept is central.

**Propagate / Propagator** — To cause something to spread through a medium. In quantum field theory, the propagator is the amplitude for a particle to travel from one spacetime point to another — the *intent* of transmission, quantified. Risk: "propagate" has connotations of slow spread (propagating vines, disease) that conflict with the momentum desired.

---

### New Candidates to Track

| Name | Why It Fits | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Resonance** | Precision amplification through frequency matching; physics, durable | Some existing uses; not saturated in agentic space |
| **Relay** | Control signal → large output; one syllable; propagation + amplification | Mass Effect association (not bad); check saturation |
| **Primer** — | Small specific input enables massive amplification; PCR, initiation | Unexpected; may need context |
| **Effector** | Terminal actor in a signaling cascade; intent finally made real | Slightly clinical; biological/immunology context |
| **Cascade** | Signal cascade = biological amplification mechanism | Overused as general metaphor |
| **Transducer** | Converts intent into execution energy | Clinical; 3 syllables; less brandable |

---

### Revised Frame on Existing Candidates

Given "amplifying intent" as primary:

- **Fulcrum** — rises. The fulcrum is precisely where amplification happens. Archimedes' framing is exactly the point. Stays near top of shortlist.
- **Impetus** — still strong, but encodes *initiation* more than *amplification*. The force that starts motion, not the mechanism that multiplies it.
- **Quorum** — interesting tension. Quorum sensing could be reframed: the threshold after which the collective amplifies a single signal into a system-wide response. Still viable.
- **Attractor** — weakens under this frame. Attractors *pull*, they don't *amplify*. Different physics.
- **Manifold** — weakens. Good for "many → one" but doesn't encode the small-input-large-output dynamic.
- **Mycel** — weakens. Beautiful, but distributed intelligence ≠ amplification.

---

## Shortlist — Revised (Post Round 2)

Ranked by fit with "amplifying intent" identity:

1. **Fulcrum** — The leverage point. Where you apply force to move something much larger. Physics, durable, precise. Archimedes' machine.
2. **Relay** — Small control signal activates large circuit. One syllable. Propagation + amplification. Has sci-fi weight.
3. **Resonance** — Precision amplification through matching. Physics. Not overused in this space.
4. **Primer** — Small specific input enables massive downstream amplification. Unexpected, scientifically precise.
5. **Quorum** — Threshold → collective amplified action. Bridges swarm and amplification.
6. **Impetus** — The initiating force. Slightly less precise on amplification, strong on momentum.
7. **Effector** — Terminal actor; intent made real. Technically precise but needs context.

---

## Names Worth Living With

Of all candidates so far, these feel most durable and likely to age well:

**Fulcrum** and **Relay** for one-syllable precision.
**Resonance** for evocative scientific depth.
**Quorum** for bridging swarm + threshold + amplification.

---

## Round 3 — Physics Deep Dive

*Directive: push harder on physics. User has pull toward Relay and Resonance. Explore related mechanisms, find adjacent candidates, and search for the name that hasn't surfaced yet.*

---

### Stimulated Emission & The Laser Analogy

Lasers are the most precise physical model for "amplifying intent" that exists. Understanding the mechanism reveals interesting candidate words.

LASER = Light Amplification by **Stimulated Emission** of Radiation.

How it works:
1. A **gain medium** is pumped with energy (the intent is loaded)
2. An incoming photon **stimulates** an excited atom to emit an *identical* photon — same direction, phase, frequency
3. The cavity mirrors keep photons bouncing through the gain medium
4. Exponential amplification: one photon becomes two, two become four
5. A coherent, directed beam exits

The vocabulary here:

- **Gain** — the amplification ratio. One syllable, technical, precise. Risk: slightly terse and generic in isolation.
- **Pump / Pumping** — the process of loading energy. "Pump" as a name: clean but too mechanical/generic.
- **Stimulate** — the mechanism of action. Too common as a verb.
- **Coherent** — waves in identical phase; what makes laser light useful. Cohere (AI company) takes this.
- **Emission** — clean but passive; suggests output not process.
- **Cavity** — where amplification occurs. Too architectural.

The most interesting derived concept: **lasing**. The verb form. To *lase* means to undergo stimulated emission amplification — to become a laser. It's a real, technical, one-syllable verb turned noun. Highly unusual as a name. Risk: unknown to non-physicists.

---

### The Soliton — A Sleeper Candidate

**Soliton** is the most interesting new candidate in this round.

A soliton is a solitary wave that travels through a medium without dispersing — maintaining its shape and speed indefinitely. It was discovered in 1834 by John Scott Russell, who observed a wave in a canal that traveled for miles without losing form, defying all expectations of fluid dynamics. It wasn't explained mathematically until decades later.

Why it's relevant:
- **In fiber optics**: solitons are used for long-distance signal transmission because they don't disperse. Intent travels intact, arrives as execution.
- **In physics**: solitons appear in plasma physics, water waves, DNA, particle physics (topological solitons), and nonlinear optics.
- **The metaphor**: an intent that enters the system as a precise pulse and arrives at execution without loss, without dispersion, still exactly what it was. The system doesn't dilute or distort. It delivers.
- Clean 3-syllable word. Uncommon in dev tooling. Scientific. Feels like a real thing (it is).

Risk: pronunciation ambiguity (SOL-ih-ton). Slightly long. But it's memorable and entirely original in this space.

---

### Control Theory — The Servo Angle

Control theory provides a different physics frame: the *servo* mechanism.

A **servomechanism** (servo) is a closed-loop control system where the output feeds back to correct the input. Small error signal → precise actuation. A servo doesn't just amplify — it amplifies *correctly*, with feedback ensuring precision.

- **Servo** — one syllable, technical, precise. Encodes: controlled amplification, feedback-driven execution, precision over brute force. Well-understood in robotics. Risk: might be too hardware/robotics-associated.
- **Actuator** — the component that converts a control signal into physical action. The actuator is what actually *does* the work in a servo system. "Actuator" is 4 syllables and feels too literal.

Related: **Effector** (revisit). In control theory, the effector is the terminal component that executes the command. In biology, effector proteins and effector cells are the final executors of a signaling cascade. Both meanings converge on: *the thing at the end of the chain that makes the intent real*.

---

### Harmonics & Resonance Variants

Going deeper on Resonance:

**Harmonic** — A harmonic is a frequency that is an integer multiple of a fundamental. Harmonics are how resonant systems amplify specific frequencies: play a string and you get the fundamental plus a series of harmonics, each amplifying certain aspects of the signal.

What it encodes:
- Amplification through frequency relationships
- Structured layers of execution (each harmonic adds to the whole)
- Musical + physical precision
- "Harmonic" sounds both mathematical and aesthetic

Risk: "harmonic" is used in some financial/trading contexts. Not overused in dev tooling.

**Overtone** — The harmonics above the fundamental. When a voice has "overtones" it means depth and richness. Slightly softer than Harmonic.

**Formant** — The resonant frequencies of a cavity that shape vocal sound. Too specific (vocal acoustics).

**Resonator** — The device or structure that exhibits resonance. A physical cavity that amplifies specific frequencies. "Resonator" vs "Resonance" — the former is more like a noun-device, the latter more abstract. Both work.

---

### Quasiparticles — Unexpected Precision

Condensed matter physics has a category of "quasiparticles" — emergent phenomena in many-body systems that behave like particles even though they're not. This category of physics word has a particular quality: real-sounding, technical, unfamiliar to most.

**Soliton** is already here (see above).

**Phonon** — A quantized unit of lattice vibration. How heat and sound travel through solids. A phonon is: many atoms vibrating together, acting as one quantum unit. Phonons carry thermal energy, mediate superconductivity, interact with electrons to create resistance or cooperation.
- Single syllable spoken as "FOH-non"
- Clean, technical, obscure-but-real
- Slightly soft phonetically
- Risk: sounds like "phone on" when spoken

**Exciton** — A bound state of an electron and the "hole" it left behind; carries energy through a material without carrying charge. Excitons are how solar cells work — absorbing photons and transferring energy without electron flow. Clean word. Unusual.

**Plasmon** — A collective oscillation of conduction electrons. Surface plasmons enable near-field optics, nanoparticle colors, and biosensors. "Plasmon" has good phonetics — two syllables, hard consonants.

**Magnon** — A quasiparticle of magnetization; propagates magnetic information through a material. "Magnon" is clean but niche.

**Roton** — A quasiparticle in superfluid helium. Very obscure.

Of these, **Soliton** and **Exciton** are most interesting as name candidates. Exciton has a nice quality: *excitation traveling through a system*, transferring energy without loss, causing things to happen downstream. It is intent in motion.

---

### The Relay Angle — Deeper

Relay in physics and engineering:

An **electromechanical relay** is fundamentally: a small coil of wire, when energized, creates a magnetic field that pulls an armature, which closes a much larger contact circuit. The *ratio* of control current to switched current can be thousands to one. A milliamp of intent switches kilowatts of execution.

The physics vocabulary of relay:

- **Armature** — the moving part of a relay or motor. The thing that *moves* when intent is applied.
- **Coil** — the controlling element. Simple, one syllable. "Coil" as a name: too soft, too Tesla.
- **Contactor** — a large-scale relay. Industrial. Interesting but heavy.
- **Solenoid** — an electromagnetic coil that creates linear motion when energized. "Solenoid" is a real, technical, one-syllable-feeling word (soh-leh-NOID). A solenoid IS intent-to-execution: electrical signal → physical linear force. Precise. Unusual as a name.
- **Plunger** — the moving component of a solenoid. No.

**Transponder** — transmitter + responder. Receives a signal, processes it, and automatically retransmits a response. Used in aviation (IFF transponders), RFID, satellite systems. The retransmission is the execution. Risk: 3 syllables, technical.

**Repeater** — amplifies and retransmits a signal. A relay is a type of repeater. "Repeater" is too literal.

**Rectifier** — converts AC to DC. Directs energy into a useful form. Not about amplification.

---

### New Candidates From Round 3

| Name | Domain | Core Concept | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soliton** | Nonlinear physics / fiber optics | A pulse that travels without dispersion; intent that arrives intact | Strong sleeper — original, scientific, durable |
| **Harmonic** | Acoustics / physics | Amplification through resonant frequency relationships | Clean, dual register (physics + music), not overused |
| **Exciton** | Condensed matter | Excitation that travels through a system transferring energy | Interesting but niche |
| **Solenoid** | Electromagnetism | Electrical signal → precise linear physical force | Technically precise, unusual as name |
| **Servo** | Control theory | Feedback-controlled amplification; precision execution | Clean but potentially too hardware-specific |
| **Plasmon** | Nanophotonics | Collective electron oscillation; surface-level amplification | Good phonetics, obscure |
| **Resonator** | Acoustics / physics | Device that amplifies specific frequencies | More concrete than "Resonance" |

---

## Updated Master Shortlist

Weighting heavily toward: *physics-precise, amplification-forward, durable, not overused in dev tooling.*

| Rank | Name | One-line rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Relay** | Small signal switches large execution. One syllable. Propagation + amplification. |
| 2 | **Fulcrum** | Leverage point: intent applied here, execution magnified there. |
| 3 | **Resonance** | Precision amplification through frequency matching. Physics + music. 3 syllables but carries weight. |
| 4 | **Soliton** | Intent that travels through the system intact, without dispersion. Scientifically precise, entirely original in this space. |
| 5 | **Harmonic** | Resonant overtone amplification. Clean dual register. |
| 6 | **Quorum** | Threshold → collective amplified response. Bridges biology and physics. |
| 7 | **Impetus** | The initial force that causes action. Clean Latin. Strong but more "initiation" than "amplification." |

**Dark horses:** Effector, Solenoid, Exciton

---

## Round 4 — Compression, Collision Check, and Final Push

*Relay is pulling ahead. Soliton: interesting but soft. Time to stress-test Relay, push the one-syllable direction harder, and see if there's anything we've missed.*

---

### Relay — Honest Assessment

**What makes it work:**
- The electromagnetic relay mechanism is a perfect model: a milliamp of control current switches kilowatts of output. Small precise intent → massive execution.
- The verb/noun duality is clean: "relay" (v) the intent; "a relay" (n) completes. The system name and the unit of work are the same word.
- Propagation semantics: relay race (baton passing), radio relay (retransmission at distance), relay station.
- Sci-fi resonance: Mass Effect's mass relays are iconic shorthand for "infrastructure that enables everything."
- One-to-two syllables (re-LAY), punchy, hard consonants at end.

**The collision:**
Meta's **Relay** is a prominent open-source GraphQL client for React, hosted at relay.dev. Well-known in frontend web communities. This matters if the audience overlaps or if OSS positioning is important.

Mitigation: if the system is infrastructure/orchestration (not frontend), the audiences may not collide meaningfully. "Relay" the orchestration system vs. "Relay" the GraphQL client are different enough that the name could still work in practice. But awareness is warranted.

---

### Final Push — One and Two Syllable Physics Words

Before converging, a complete sweep of the most compressed candidates, rated for fit:

**One syllable:**

| Word | Domain | Fit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Arc** | Electrical / geometry | Medium | An arc IS electricity jumping across a gap — energy at threshold, sudden release. Clean. But too visual/trajectory. |
| **Coil** | Electromagnetism | Low | The winding creates the magnetic field. Too component-level. |
| **Core** | Magnetics / architecture | Low | Too generic. |
| **Flux** | Field theory | Low | React-era. Rejected. |
| **Gate** | Electronics / logic | Medium-high | Gate voltage controls transistor amplification. Logic gates transform signals. One syllable. Clean. Risk: "gateway" overuse, gatekeeping. |
| **Node** | Networks | Low | Too generic. |
| **Phase** | Wave physics | Low | Too generic. |
| **Pulse** | Signal physics | Medium | A discrete burst of energy or signal. Regular, rhythmic. Clean. Risk: pulse.io, health apps. |
| **Rail** | Electronics | Medium | Power rails carry supply voltage. "Rail" implies the infrastructure carrying the signal. Clean, unusual. |
| **Surge** | Power / signal | Low | Surge = dangerous overcurrent. Wrong direction. |
| **Wire** | Electronics | Low | Too literal. |
| **Drive** | Mechanics / signal | Low | Too generic. |
| **Torque** | Mechanics | Medium-high | Rotational force applied at a distance = amplification. Clean, one syllable, unusual in software. Less collision risk than Relay. |

**Two syllables:**

| Word | Domain | Fit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Relay** | Electromagnetism | High | See above. Leading candidate with Meta collision risk. |
| **Pulsar** | Astrophysics | Medium | Rhythmic precision emission. Powerful. But encodes regularity more than amplification. |
| **Photon** | Quantum physics | Medium | Massless, travels at c. Too used as a brand. |
| **Hadron** | Particle physics | Low | LHC adjacent. Technically precise. No amplification semantic. |
| **Boson** | Quantum field theory | Medium | Force-carrying particle. Higgs boson cultural moment. Unusual. No amplification semantic. |
| **Fulcrum** | Classical mechanics | High | Leverage point. Still strong. See Round 1/2. |
| **Modulus** | Mathematics | Medium | Magnitude/amplitude; elasticity. Clean but passive. |
| **Servo** | Control theory | Medium | Feedback-controlled precision execution. Too hardware-adjacent. |
| **Proton** | Particle physics | Low | Proton mail. Too used. |
| **Torchon** | — | — | Not a word. |
| **Cipher** | Cryptography | Low | Encodes/decodes. Wrong semantic. |

---

### The Torque Case

**Torque** deserves a more serious look as a Relay alternative.

- τ = r × F (torque = moment arm × force applied)
- Small force, applied at a distance from a pivot, creates enormous rotational acceleration
- It IS mechanical amplification — the formula embeds the leverage principle
- One syllable, hard consonants, sounds like it does something real
- Not used in serious dev tooling (Torque for WordPress is a minor player; Torque Android app is niche)
- Doesn't have the Meta collision problem
- Slightly less semantic depth than Relay on the "propagation/chain" angle
- Risk: "torque" is very mechanical/automotive in common usage (car torque specs)

---

### Compound Name Angle — One More Pass

The reference anchor "Fragments Engine" is a compound where each word earns its place. Testing:

**[Force concept] + Engine:**
- **Relay Engine** — clean. The engine that relays. But "relay" as verb + "engine" as mechanism might feel redundant.
- **Resonance Engine** — very close to Fragments Engine quality. The engine that amplifies through frequency matching. Three words' worth of meaning in two. Strong.
- **Fulcrum Engine** — the engine at the leverage point.

**[Force concept] + Runner / Dispatch / Core:**
- **Signal Engine** — too generic
- **Relay Core** — clean but core = too generic
- **Relay Run** — interesting

Single word is probably stronger for this system. Compounds if nothing single lands.

---

### Pre-Shortlist Reflection

At this point we have a strong leading candidate (Relay), one strong backup (Fulcrum, Resonance), and some interesting alternatives. Before closing:

**What Relay has that nothing else does:**
- The physical mechanism is exactly the use case (small signal → large execution)
- One-word doubles as the unit of work (a "relay" completes)
- Propagation semantics built in
- Sci-fi precedent that doesn't feel gamey

**What could displace Relay:**
- A one-syllable word with the same mechanism but no collision risk
- A two-syllable word with more depth and similar fit
- A name from a direction we haven't explored

**Unexplored angles remaining:**
- Coined words / portmanteaus (if desired)
- Latin/Greek roots recombined
- Very short words from engineering that aren't in the shortlist yet

## Round 5 — Coined & Compressed Words

*Directive: Find names that don't exist yet but feel like they should. Root-first approach: derive from physics/Greek/Latin roots. The best coined names sound like real physics terms the user simply hasn't encountered yet.*

---

### Source Roots: What We're Working With

The core concept: *intent enters → forces amplify → execution emerges*

**Relevant root vocabulary:**

| Root | Origin | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| *erg-* | Greek *ergon* | work, deed, action | energy, synergy, ergonomics |
| *kinet-* | Greek *kinein* | to move | kinetic, kinase, cinema |
| *dynam-* | Greek *dynamis* | power, potential | dynamic, dynamo, dynamite |
| *puls-* / *pel-* | Latin *pellere* | to drive, push | impulse, compel, propel, expel |
| *ag-* / *act-* | Latin *agere* | to do, drive | agent, action, actuate |
| *vol-* | Latin *volo* / *velox* | will / swift | volition, velocity |
| *eff-* | Latin *efficere* | to carry out | effect, effector, efficient |
| *mis-* / *mit-* | Latin *mittere* | to send | mission, emit, transmit |
| *duc-* | Latin *ducere* | to lead | conduct, induct, deduce |
| *prax-* | Greek *praxis* | doing, action (vs. theory) | praxis, practical |
| *telos-* | Greek *telos* | end, goal, purpose | teleology, telescope |
| *dynamis-* | Greek | potential, power | — |
| *energeia-* | Greek | being at work (Aristotle) | energy |

---

### Existing-But-Obscure Words (Best Candidates)

These are real words that exist in specialized domains but are functionally unknown in software:

**Ergon** (ἔργον)
- Greek for "work," "deed," "action"
- The root of *energy* (ἐν-εργεία = being at work), *synergy* (syn + ergon = working together), *ergonomics*
- In physics, an erg is a unit of energy (CGS system). *Ergon* is the source.
- Two syllables: ER-gon. Hard consonants. Lands cleanly.
- Encodes: the work that the system does. Pure action.
- Not used in dev tooling.
- **Strong candidate.**

**Praxis** (πρᾶξις)
- Greek for "action" — specifically action that *actualizes* knowledge or intent; Aristotle's term for doing as distinct from knowing (theoria) or making (poiesis)
- Praxis = intent made real. The turning of intent into lived action.
- Two syllables: PRAK-sis.
- Used in philosophy/pedagogy ("praxis-oriented education"), but not in dev tooling.
- Collision: "The Praxis" (teacher certification tests in the US). Limited overlap for infrastructure tooling.
- **Strong candidate.** Perhaps the cleanest semantic fit for the core function.

**Dynamis** (δύναμις)
- Aristotle's concept: the *potential* for action, as opposed to *energeia* (being at work). A seed has dynamis — it could become a tree.
- Three syllables: DY-nah-mis. Clean but longer.
- The root of *dynamic* and *dynamo*. The potential before the release.
- Not used in dev tooling.
- Risk: slightly abstract (potential > amplification); also 3 syllables.

**Impetus** (already in shortlist)
- Latin: the force that initiates motion. From *impetere* — to rush at, to attack.
- Clean, clean word. Three syllables: IM-peh-tus. But feels natural.
- Already on the shortlist.

**Tractus**
- Latin: the action of drawing/pulling; a tract (as in a region or a piece of writing)
- In anatomy: the *tractus* is a bundle of nerve fibers carrying signals
- Two syllables: TRAK-tus. Very clean.
- Encodes: drawing intent forward; the pathway of execution.
- Not used in dev tooling.

---

### Portmanteaus and Compressed Forms

**Reson**
- Compressed form of "resonance": res-ON
- Two syllables. Sounds like a real physics instrument term.
- Could be pronounced REH-zon (like "reason") or reh-ZON (like "resonance" compressed)
- Risk: "reason" homophone might confuse branding.
- Clean, portmanteau quality. Feels real without being real.

**Ergant**
- *erg-* (work) + *-ant* (active agent suffix: *servant*, *assistant*, *militant*)
- "that which works / the acting work-agent"
- Two syllables: ER-gant. Lands like an adjective-turned-noun.
- Feels like a real physics term but isn't. Precisely in the Nanite register.
- Not a real word. Entirely coined.
- **Interesting sleeper.**

**Pulsact**
- *puls-* (pulse/drive) + *act-* (action)
- The action-pulse: intent driven forward into execution
- Two syllables: PULS-akt. Harsh, precise.
- Too obviously compound. Feels like two words awkwardly fused.

**Dynact**
- *dynam-* + *act-*
- The dynamic act / powered action
- One syllable when collapsed: DY-nakt.
- Sounds like something that could be in particle physics. But also sounds like a company name.

**Kinact**
- *kinet-* + *act-*
- Motion in action
- KY-nakt or kih-NAKT
- Feels slightly pharmaceutical. Probably not.

**Agentum** / **Agentem**
- Fake Latin for "the work/thing of agents"
- ah-JEN-tum / ah-JEN-tem
- Sounds like a supplement or a character name. Not right.

**Relance**
- *relay* + *lance* (to thrust forward)
- reh-LANS: to relay with thrust
- Interesting portmanteau but slightly odd. The words don't fuse naturally.

---

### Assessment: Coined vs. Real

After systematic exploration, a pattern emerges: **the best candidates in this space are real-but-obscure words, not pure coinages.**

Coinages in the physics/Latin register tend to either:
1. Sound pharmaceutical (*Kinact*, *Dynact*, *Ergant*?)
2. Sound like a startup brand (*Velox*, *Kinexa*)
3. Feel obviously compound (*Pulsact*, *Relance*)

The exception would be something like "Nanite" — which works because *nano-* is ubiquitous and *-ite* is a natural mineral suffix. The combination feels inevitable rather than constructed.

For a parallel Nanite-quality coinage, we'd need:
- A root that's as broadly known as "nano" but in the physics/execution domain
- A suffix that's as natural as "-ite"

**Possible structure:**
- *erg-* + *-on* → **Ergon** (already exists! See above)
- *kinet-* + *-on* → **Kineton** — a unit of motion? Three syllables: KIN-eh-ton. Clean but long.
- *ag-* + *-on* → **Agon** — already a Greek word meaning "contest/struggle"! Has philosophy background. One syllable feeling.
- *puls-* + *-ar* → **Pulsar** — already a word (neutron star)
- *dynam-* + *-on* → **Dynamon** — too long
- *vol-* + *-on* → **Volon** — unit of will? Two syllables, clean, not a real word.

**Volon** is a genuinely interesting coinage:
- *vol-* from Latin *volo* (I want/will) + -on (particle suffix)
- Sounds like: a quasiparticle of volition; a quantum of will
- Two syllables: VO-lon. Rhymes with "proton," "photon"
- Feels like it belongs in a physics glossary
- Not a real word. Entirely original.
- Encodes: a unit of intent/will in the particle physics register
- Risk: "voilà" adjacent in sound? Or "vol" as in volume?

### New Candidates From Round 5

| Name | Type | Core Concept | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ergon** | Existing Greek word | Work/action; root of energy and synergy | Strong — real, unused, precise |
| **Praxis** | Existing Greek word | The actualization of intent into action | Strong — semantically perfect, limited collision |
| **Volon** | Coined | Quasiparticle of volition/will | Interesting — feels like physics, entirely original |
| **Ergant** | Coined | Acting work-agent; the force of execution | Interesting — Nanite register |
| **Tractus** | Existing Latin term | The pathway/bundle along which signals travel | Sleeper — unusual, anatomical, precise |
| **Reson** | Portmanteau | Compressed resonance | Clean but "reason" homophone |
| **Dynamis** | Existing Greek | Power/potential before release | Clean but 3 syllables, slightly passive |

## Session Close — Final Summary

### What We Learned About the System's Identity

The most important clarification in this session: the system's primary identity is **amplifying intent**, not coordinating agents. Small, precise input → large, far-reaching execution. This is the physics of leverage, signal amplification, and cascade dynamics. Every name on the final shortlist fits this frame.

### The Final Shortlist — Annotated

**1. Relay**
*The current frontrunner.*

A small control signal (milliamps) switches a much larger circuit (kilowatts). The ratio can be thousands to one. The mechanism is physically exact for "amplifying intent." One-to-two syllables, hard consonants, punchy. The word doubles as the unit of work: "a relay completed," "fire a relay," "the relay failed." Propagation semantics are built in (relay race, radio relay, relay station). Sci-fi weight without feeling gamey.

Known collision: Meta's Relay (GraphQL client for React, relay.dev). Audience overlap assessed as minimal. Name should proceed.

**2. Praxis**
*The semantically perfect newcomer.*

Aristotle's distinction: *theoria* (knowing), *poiesis* (making), *praxis* (doing — action that actualizes knowledge). Praxis is not just action — it is action as the realization of intent. The system *is* praxis: intent enters, action emerges. Two syllables, hard consonants (PRAK-sis), not soft or cute. Limited collision in dev tooling; the main conflict is US teacher certification testing (low overlap).

Why it's worth living with: it says precisely the right thing without trying to, and it holds up under repetition.

**3. Volon**
*The bold coinage.*

Derived from Latin *volo* (I want, I will) + the quasiparticle suffix *-on* (photon, proton, soliton). A *volon* is — by invention — a quantum of volition; a unit of intent. Two syllables: VO-lon. It sits in the register of particle physics but does not exist in any physics glossary. Entirely original in this naming space. Encodes: the smallest meaningful unit of will that the system processes and amplifies.

Risk: because it's coined, it carries an explain-it tax. But the explanation is one sentence and is memorable. This is the name most likely to *surprise* the right audience and be immediately adopted.

**4. Resonance**
*The physics-music crossover.*

Amplification through precision, not force. A singer doesn't overpower glass — she finds the right frequency. Small input, enormous effect, through matching rather than force. Three syllables (REZ-on-ance) but they carry weight. Has crossover into both physics and music without being soft. The compound "Resonance Engine" is excellent — the same structure as "Fragments Engine."

If the name needs to work in compound form, this is the strongest option.

**5. Fulcrum**
*The Archimedes machine.*

τ = r × F. The pivot point where force is multiplied. Small force, applied correctly, moves the world. Encodes leverage, infrastructure, and amplification simultaneously. Two syllables: FUL-krum. Durable, physics-grounded, not soft. The risk is some existing tooling use — needs a quick check.

**6. Ergon**
*The quiet one.*

Greek for "work" and "action." The root of *energy* (ἐν-εργεία = being at work), *synergy*, and *ergonomics*. Two syllables: ER-gon. Clean, hard, entirely unused in dev tooling. No explain-it tax for a technical audience (most will have seen it in chemistry or biology). Encodes: this is where work happens.

Less flashy than the others, but perhaps the most durable of the six.

### Directions That Were Explored and Why They Fell

| Rejected Direction | Why |
|---|---|
| Gradient | ML/AI community owns this word completely |
| Tensor | TensorFlow shadow |
| Vector | Security "attack vector" association |
| Cadence | Uber's Cadence workflow engine |
| Nexus | Dev tooling overuse |
| Manifold | Right concept, but "many-into-one" rather than amplification |
| Mycelium/Mycel | Beautiful but biological rather than physics; trending risk |
| Soliton | Interesting concept, right feeling, but "soft" in resonance |
| Quorum | Excellent for swarm/threshold; weaker for amplification-primary frame |
| Coined hybrids | Tended to land pharmaceutical or startup-brand (Kinact, Ergant, Reson) |

### How to Use This Shortlist

**Live with them for 7–14 days before deciding.** The best name will be the one that still feels right after you've typed it into commit messages, said it out loud in explanation, and used it as a prefix for sub-components.

**Tests worth running:**
1. `[Name] run` — does it work as a command verb?
2. `[Name] complete` — does it work as a status?
3. `a [name]` vs `the [name]` — which article fits naturally?
4. Can you name a sub-component? (e.g., "a Relay worker," "a Praxis task," "a Volon dispatch")

**Current ranking by likely durability:**

1. **Relay** — most immediately usable, clear, functional
2. **Praxis** — most semantically precise, highest conceptual fit
3. **Volon** — highest originality, highest explain-it tax
4. **Fulcrum** — excellent but most dependent on collision check
5. **Resonance** — strongest as a compound; less clean as single word
6. **Ergon** — most durable, quietest, least distinctive on first contact
