# Pause State — Volon Rebrand

Paused after completing the Volon branding sweep and CLI rename. Remaining work (for
next session):

1. Rename the local repo folder from `forge` → `volon-dev`.
2. Coordinate the GitHub rename so `origin` points to `git@github.com:hollis-labs/volon-dev.git`.
3. Confirm `scripts/volon-cli.sh` and `volon task …` work after the folder/remote rename.

Resume by reopening this repo (post-rename) and following `.volon/reboot-prompt.md`.
